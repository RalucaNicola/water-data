        <p>Over the last decades Indiaâ€™s economy and population have
          grown rapidly. This has increased the pressure on their freshwater resources. Due to
          the lack of water management in India this has resulted in water scarcity.</p>

        <p>To improve human well-being the agricultural practices
          have intensified in India. This has led to a high consumption of water by the
          agricultural sector. Also, there are few regulations of water resources by the
          government to reduce agricultural water use or improve efficiency of the system.

        <p>In Mexico the water scarcity problems are most severe in
          the large cities. Water service systems are managed inefficiently, often mainly
          affecting the poorest as they live in informal settings without access to the water
          network.

        <p>After the second world war Japan had a rapid economic
          growth. The industrial water use is relatively high as the Japanese economy relies
          heavily on their large industrial sector. On the other hand improvements in water use
          efficiency and water management have resulted in a recent decrease in (industrial)
          water use.
